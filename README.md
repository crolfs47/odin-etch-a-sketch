## The Odin Project - Etch-A-Sketch

Second JavaScript project - create a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - HTML/CSS/JavaScript
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github
 - Chrome developer tools
 - Flexbox

## What I learned:
 - Better understanding of breaking things down into functions and calling them with event listeners
 - Better understanding of nested loops to create grid of divs
 - Adding and removing elements and classes in the DOM using JavaScript
 - Changing CSS style (size, background color, etc) using JavaScript
 
## Still can improve:
 - More user options: select color, gradient option, etc.
 - Improve user interface and CSS
 - Make grid size adjust if bigger than window size
 - Mobile support and browser compatibility
